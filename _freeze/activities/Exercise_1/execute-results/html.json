In these exercises, the goal is to:\n\n-   Familiarize yourself with the `ggplot()` structure and grammar.\n-   Build *univariate* viz, i.e. viz for 1 variable at a time.\n-   Start recognizing the different approaches for visualizing categorical vs quantitative variables.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n**Directions**\n\n-   General\n    -   Be kind to yourself.\n    -   Collaborate with and be kind to others. You are expected to work together as a group.\n    -   Ask questions. Remember that we won't discuss these exercises as a class.\n-   Activity specific\n    -   The best way to learn `ggplot` is to just play around. Focus on the *patterns* and *potential* of the code. Don't worry about memorizing anything! You will naturally start to remember the most important / common code the more and more you use it.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 1: Research questions {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's dig into the `hikes` data, starting with the `elevation` and difficulty `ratings` of the hikes:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhikes <- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv\")\n\nhead(hikes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt.

What features would we like a visualization of the *categorical* difficulty `rating` variable to capture?\n\n**A bar graph would best visualize the rating of the categorical variable difficulties.**\n\nb.  What about a visualization of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable?\n\n**A histogram would best visualize the quantitative variable elevations.** \n\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 2: Load tidyverse {.unnumbered}\n\nWe'll address the above questions using `ggplot` tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message -- this is one you'll get a lot!\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use `ggplot` tools, we have to first *load* the `tidyverse` package in which they live. Mainly, we've *installed* the package but need to tell R when we want to *use* it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You'll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses `ggplot()`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 3: Bar chart of ratings (part 1) {.unnumbered}\n\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty `rating` of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category? Are the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a **bar chart**; of (2) the *categorical* data recorded in the `rating` column. First, set up the plotting **frame**:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\n-   What did this do? What do you observe?\n-   What, in general, is the first argument of the `ggplot()` function?\n-   What is the purpose of writing `x = rating`?\n-   What do you think `aes` stands for?!?\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 4: Bar chart of ratings (part 2) {.unnumbered}\n\nNow let's add a **geometric layer** to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot's **theme**. To this end, try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\nNOTE:\n\n-   Pay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\n-   Not all of these are \"good\" plots. We're just exploring `ggplot`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The data was added within the frame for difficulty ratings of each hike. \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This data is comparing the number of hikes and the difficulty rating. \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This histogram is comparing the number of hikes and difficulty rating and simultaneously filling the bars with blue. \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This histogram does the same as the last chart but outlines the bars in orange. \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This turned the background white. \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 5: Bar chart follow-up {.unnumbered}\n\n### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nReflect on the `ggplot()` code.\n\n-   What's the purpose of the `+`? When do we use it?\n\n      *The plus is to add layers to your ggplot.*\n\n-   We added the bars using `geom_bar()`? Why \"geom\"?\n\n      *Geom refers to the geometric object we use to visualize the data.* \n\n-   What does `labs()` stand for?\n\n      *Labels, you can modify ggplot labels with this function.* \n\n-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?\n\n      *Color outlines while fill fills in the entire shape.* \n\n### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a *categorical* variable:\n\n-   **observed categories**: What categories did we observe?\n\n      *We observed `rating`.* \n\n-   **variability between categories**: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\n\n      *The moderate category is more common, so they are not spread evenly.*\n\nWe must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize here what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n\n*Most hikes in the Adirondacks are moderate, second most are easy, and the least amount of hikes are difficult.*\n\n### Part c {.unnumbered}\n\nIs there anything you don't like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\n\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 6: Sad bar chart {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's now consider some research questions related to the *quantitative* `elevation` variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what's the *range* of elevation and how are the hikes *distributed* within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, \"normally\")? What's a *typical* elevation? Are there any *outliers*, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\n-   Construct a **bar chart** of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable.\n-   Explain why this might *not* be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)\n\n*This is not helpful for mapping quantitative variables because it can only map a singular variable.*\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 7: A histogram of elevation {.unnumbered}\n\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable, it's typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we've observed a particular outcome (as the bar graph did above). It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We'll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\n\n**Histograms** are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into 'bins' of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\n![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/histogram_demo.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's dig into some details.\n\n-   How many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n\n*About 6.*\n\n-   How many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n\n*3 or 4.*\n\n### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a *quantitative* variable:\n\n-   **typical outcome:** Whereâ€™s the center of the data points? What's typical?\n-   **variability & range:** How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n-   **shape:** How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n-   **outliers:** Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize here what you learned from the histogram, in context.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 8: Building histograms (part 1) {.unnumbered}\n\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to *intuit* what line you can tack on to the below frame of `elevation` to add a histogram layer. Don't forget a `+`. If it doesn't come to you within 2 minutes, *no problem* -- all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the \"density\" of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve **always equals 1** and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\n\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation -- it's a relative measure. The *higher* the density, the more *common* are elevations in that range.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**Questions**\n\n-   INTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to `geom_bar()` and `geom_histogram()`, how do you *anticipate* the following code will change the plot?\n\n    -   `geom_density(color = \"blue\")`\n    \n    *This will outline the line in blue.*\n    \n    -   `geom_density(fill = \"orange\")`\n    \n    *This will fill everything under the line with orange.* \n\n-   TRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Examine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the *typical* elevation, *variability / range* in elevations, and *shape* of the distribution of *elevations* within this range?\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 12: Density plots vs histograms {.unnumbered}\n\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Exercise 13: Code = communication {.unnumbered}\n\nWe *obviously* won't be done until we talk about communication.
