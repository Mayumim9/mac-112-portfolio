# Exercise 2: Import tidy data

survey \<- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/112_fall_2024_survey.csv") View(survey)

# Exercise 3: Tidy data properties

-   What are the units of observation, ie, what does each row represent?

*Individual students and their preferences*

-   Name one quantitative variable, ie, column, in the dataset. Preferred distance from Macalester food

*Students preferred distance from campus*

-   Name one categorical variable, ie, column, in the dataset. Preferred Cafe Mac food

*Students favorite food at Cafe Mac*

# Exercise 4: Get to know the data

**dim(survey)** tells you the total number of observations and variables

**nrow(survey)** tells you the number of total rows in the data set

**head(survey)** shows you the first n rows in the data set

**head(survey, 3)** shows the first three rows in the data set

**tail(survey)** shows the last n rows in a data set

**names(survey)** this lists the variables in a data set

# Exercise 5: Data structure

class(survey)

Overall class is data.frame

str(survey)

# Exercise 6: Your turn

**Import and name the dataset (you pick a name!)**

world_cup \<- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv")

**Print the first 6 rows of the dataset**

head(world_cup, 6)

**How many years of data do we have? And how many measurements do we have on each year?**

Years of data = nrow(world_cup), 21 years of data

Number of measurements = dim(world_cup), 10 measurements

**Get a list of all variable names in the dataset**

names(world_cup) = "year" "host" "winner" "second" "third" "fourth" "goals_scored" "teams" "games" "attendance"

**Display the class and other information for each variable in the dataset**

class(world_cup) = data.frame

str(world_cup) =

'data.frame': 21 obs. of 10 variables:

\$ year : int 1930 1934 1938 1950 1954 1958 1962 1966 1970 1974 ...

\$ host : chr "Uruguay" "Italy" "France" "Brazil" ...

# Exercise 7: Brainstorm

-   Who hosted the World Cup in 1958?

-   How many teams were at the 1994 World Cup?

-   What is the total attendance of every World Cup since 2002?
